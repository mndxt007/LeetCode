/*
You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes.
The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group,
which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash
inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.

Example 1:
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

Example 2:
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part
as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
1 <= k <= 104

    int currentIndex = k - 1;
    char[] currentGroup = new char[k];
    for (int i = s.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        if (s[i] == '-')
            continue;
        currentGroup[currentIndex--] = s[i];
        if (currentIndex < 0)
        {
            result.Add(new(currentGroup));
            currentIndex = k - 1;
        }
    }
    if (currentIndex < k - 1)
        result.Add(new(currentGroup[(currentIndex+1)..]));
    result.Reverse();
    return String.Join('-', result.Select(group => group.ToUpper()));
